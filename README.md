TIME SERIES ANALYSIS<br>
<br>
In this project I am analyzing S&P 500 database from Kaggle. S&P 500, abbreviation of Standard and Poorâ€™s 500,<br>
a stock market index in the United States that tracks 500 publicly traded domestic companies. It is considered <br>
by many investors to be the best overall measurement of American stock market performance.<br> 
In this analysis, I am focusing on the predictive technics of Machine Learning, how they are performing on a <br>
totally random dataset like stockmarket prices.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;    - Simple Moving Average</br>
&emsp;&emsp;    - ARMA (autoregressive moving average)</br>
 &emsp;&emsp;   - GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity)</br>
  &emsp;&emsp;  - ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average)</br>
  &emsp;&emsp;  - SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA)</br>
 &emsp;&emsp;   - PROPHET</br>
 &emsp; &emsp;  -Neural network:</br>
 &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;      - 1 LSTM layer + RELU activation function</br>
&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;       - 3 LSTM layers + Relu activation</br>
&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;       - 2 Bidirectional LSTM layers + Huber loss function</br>
