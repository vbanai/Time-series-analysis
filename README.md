TIME SERIES ANALYSIS<br>
<br>
In this project I am analyzing S&P 500 database from Kaggle. S&P 500, abbreviation of Standard and Poorâ€™s 500,<br>
a stock market index in the United States that tracks 500 publicly traded domestic companies. It is considered <br>
by many investors to be the best overall measurement of American stock market performance.<br> 
In this analysis, I am focusing on the predictive technics of Machine Learning, how they are performing on a <br>
totally random dataset like stockmarket prices.<br>
<br>
Technics which can be used for oredicting only the next future value:<br>
- "Naive" forecast (using only the previous data for the predicted value)<br>
- Moving average<br>
- Differencing + moving average + bringing back the trend<br>
- One layer neural network<br>
- Bidirectional LSTM model<br>
 <br>
Naive forecast proved to be the best model in predicting one future value<br>
<br>
Technics I tried and being appropriate for predicting series of future values:<br>
- AR model<br>
- ARMA model<br>
- ARIMA model<br>
- SARIMA model<br>
- Prophet<br>
<br>
ARIMA and PROPHET proved to be the best model in predicting long term data
